This is a test paragraph that i'll be using for my PyParagraph homework assignment. In analyzing this paragraph, I hope to find approximate word count, approximate sentence count, average word length in characters and average sentence length in words. This will be a fun project for me! I think the letter-shifting cipher activity I completed will be great practice for this. In that activity, I read through a string one character at a time and found the alphabetical index of those characters. I then created a cipher that would shift all letters of the message up or down the alphabet a specified number of characters. This will be a more engaging project but I hope to have it up and running soon. That's all I have to say! Let's go!
